# This toolchain file configures CMake options for Windows User Mode x86 compilation with CPU optimizations.
# To use the toolchain file, run cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake-toolchain/WindowsUserMode-X86.cmake -A Win32
#
# (The "-A Win32" option seems to be required when compiling on a 64-bit host. Ideally this toolchain file
# should set all the required options, but I haven't figured out how to force 32-bit compilation from the
# toolchain file, so if you don't provide "-A Win32" it will try to use the 64-bit compiler and assembler
# and will fail.)
